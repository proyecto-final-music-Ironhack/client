### Description

Beat the beat connects clubs and djs for the purpose of allowing users to find out what parties are happening in their city.
The club creates the event that is going to happen, associates a dj, and the dj is in charge of selecting a playlist. The event will appear on the map a few days before it happens, and when it starts, the user will have access to vote the playlist order.

### MVP

The user checks in and has access to the list of songs the dj is going to play and can vote on the playback order.

### Built with:

- Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- React.js, Axios
- APIs: Spotify, Cloudinary, MapBox
- Chakra UI
